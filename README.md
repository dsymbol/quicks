# Quicks
An account manager that makes switching between Overwatch accounts easier and less time consuming, automatically opens the game and logs in to your account.

Will not use the [Battle.net](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/apps/battle.net/desktop) app, resulting in a much faster login procedure with less processes to start, which is especially handy for users with numerous Overwatch smurfs.
